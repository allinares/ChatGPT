Prompt:
What is a class in JavaScript?

Response:
In JavaScript, a class is a blueprint for creating objects with similar properties and behaviors. It defines the structure and behavior of objects of a certain type.

Classes were introduced in ECMAScript 2015 (ES6) to provide a more familiar and structured way to create objects and deal with inheritance compared to the previous prototype-based approach.

Here's a basic example of a class in JavaScript:

class Car {
  constructor(make, model, year) {
    this.make = make;
    this.model = model;
    this.year = year;
  }

  displayInfo() {
    console.log(`This car is a ${this.year} ${this.make} ${this.model}.`);
  }
}

// Creating an instance of the Car class
let myCar = new Car('Toyota', 'Camry', 2020);
myCar.displayInfo(); // Output: This car is a 2020 Toyota Camry.

In this example:

    Car is the class.
    constructor is a special method used for initializing objects created with the class. It is called automatically when a new instance of the class is created.
    displayInfo is a method defined within the class.
    myCar is an instance of the Car class.

Classes in JavaScript can also include inheritance, where one class can inherit properties and methods from another class. This helps in creating a hierarchy of classes with shared characteristics.
